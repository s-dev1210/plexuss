# Development
##### Staging Server: https://example.com
Any barnch can be deployed to this server for testing

1. The main branch is ****, so every new feature branch must be craeted from this branch.
2. Webpack is used for bundling  **JS** files. Currently we are bundling ***Admin Dashboard** and **StudentAPP** modules. (Install webpack globally and version less than 1.15)
3. After making changes to the js files, run
    ```
    npm run build_student   # For Student Module
    npm run build_dashboard # For admin dashboard
    ```
    This out put will be like this, updating the 2 files
    ```
